node utility for read/write lockfiles

This is the only node package as of this writing I'm aware of that allows you to have read/write lockfiles. If you're looking for a simpler solution, check out [proper-lockfile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proper-lockfile). Use this package if you need read/write lock support.

This follows the standard [Readers-Writers Lock design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writer_lock). Any number of readers are allowed at one time. 1 writer is allowed at one time iff there are no current readers.

Usage
=====

```js
const {RWLockfile} = require('rwlockfile')

// 'myfile' is the path to a file to use as the base for the lockfile
// it will add '.lock' to the end for the actual lockfile, so in this case 'myfile.lock'
let lock = new RWLockfile('myfile', {
  // how long to wait until timeout. Default: 30000
  timeout: 30000,
  // mininum time to wait between checking for locks
  // automatically adds some noise and duplicates this number each check
  retryInterval: 10,
})

// add a reader async or synchronously. If the count is >= 1 it creates a read lock
await lock.add('read')
lock.addSync('read')

// remove a reader async or synchronously. If the count == 0 it creates removes the read lock
lock.remove('read')
lock.removeSync('read')

// add a writer async or synchronously
lock.add('write')
lock.addSync('write')
```
